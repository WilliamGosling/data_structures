# C Data Structures Library

A collection of fundamental data structures implemented from scratch in pure C. This library is built to be efficient, clean, and well-documented, demonstrating core computer science concepts and C programming proficiency.

This project was developed to build a strong foundation in systems-level programming, manual memory management, and algorithmic design.

## Data Structures Included
- Doubly Linked List
- Dynamic Array
- Priority Queue
- Graph
- Hashmap
- Binary Search Tree
